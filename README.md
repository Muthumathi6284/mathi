SecureCheck: A Python-SQL Digital Ledger for Police Post Logs
SecureCheck is a streamlined, secure, and scalable digital ledger system built using Python, Streamlit, and SQL. It is designed to digitally log, manage, and audit all entries at police posts or security checkpoints, replacing traditional handwritten registers with a centralized and efficient digital system.

The goal of SecureCheck is to:

Ensure transparent tracking of all visitors and personnel.

Eliminate the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of paper-based logging.

Provide real-time data access and analytics to authorized officers.

Improve security, accountability, and operational efficiency at police posts.
